## Welcome to my reading notes!

### *To me, a "growth mindset" means focusing on continuous improvement. This is a diligent, daily practice that requires internal evaluation and assessment.*

### Three ways that I can maintain a growth mindset:
  - Active Listening
  - Ask frequent, genuine questions
  - Diligently work to understand, failure to prepare is failure to grow

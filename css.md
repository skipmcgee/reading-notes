#### Notes from Chapter 10

- CCS works by matching an HTML element to a rule to govern how the element should be displayed
- CCS rules consist of a selector and a declaration
- Declarations consist of a property and a value
- Use a single style sheet to maintain the formatting for multiple pages, use the HTML <link> element to specify the file
- Some authors use one CSS file for formatting and another for layout
- We can use a style tag with type="text/CSS" for inline CSS formatting, usually better to use a separate file
- The link element (includes href, type & rel) inside the head identifies the pointer to the CSS file
- One link element is required for each CSS file
- Online tools to test webpage in different browsers: BrowserCam.com, BrowserLab.Adobe.com, BrowserShots.org, CrossBrowserTesting.com
- For CSS bugs check these resources: PositionIsEverything.net, QuirksMode.org
 
#### Notes from Chapter 11

- The color property specifies the color of text using RGB values, Hex Codes or Color Names
- CSS3 also uses HSLA to specify colors
- Colors are created by mixing Red, Green & Blue
- RGB example: rgb(102,205,170) 102=Red, 205=Green & 170=Blue
- Hex example: "66cdaa" 66=Red, cd=Green, aa=Blue
- Color Name example: MediumAquaMarine (only 147 Options)
- When picking color, consider hue, saturation, brightness & contrast
- CSS3 adds opacity in "rgba" format where the "a" is the opacity value
- CSS3 also adds the capability to specify color in HSL values with an optional opacity value called HSLA

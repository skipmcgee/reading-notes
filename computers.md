### Functions of a computer:
- input
- storage
- processing
- output

### 1s & 0s:
- bit: on/off, yes/no, binary
- binary postions (multiply by 2 R->L)

### Circuts:
- 'not' reverse signal
- 'and' if both, then yes
- 'adder' = sum

### Chain of information:
- Keyboard converts input to a number
- Converted to binary by the CPU and stored in memory
- CPU converts the binary from memory to pixels and outputs the pixel information to memory
- the graphics card / CPU then outputs the pixels to the display

### CPU
- central processing unit
- circuits for math/logic
- circuits to send/receive information
- adder / store circuits
- binary executed in sequence
- os manages software that controls computer hardware

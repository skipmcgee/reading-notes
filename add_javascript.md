### Comparison and logical operators:
- better to use the strict syntax: === or !=== to compate value and type
- expressions are often enclosed in ()
- operands can be expressions
- logical operators allow you to compare the results of one or more comparison operators
- examples: && (logical and), || (logical or), ! (logical not)
- if evaluates a condition and then executes if true
- if (expression in parenthesis) then {expression in curly braces}
- if, else if, else
- switch statements: based on a variable, executes a specific case then breaks
- switch statements are faster and live inside one code block
- switch has a default option to run if no cases are matched
- break skips the rest of the code block and continues on to the next
- JavaScript does type coercion by default, converting '35' into 35
- weak typing = var datatype can change
- logical operators process left to right and stop as soon as they have a result

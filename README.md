## *Hello!*

***My name is Skip McGee, I'm learning and developing coding skills!***

### To me, a "growth mindset" means focusing on continuous improvement. This is a diligent, daily practice that requires internal evaluation and assessment.
### Three ways that I can maintain a growth mindset:
  - Active Listening
  - Ask frequent, genuine questions
  - Diligently work to understand, failure to prepare is failure to grow

### Please check out my [main](https://skipmcgee.github.io) GitHub page and my [code](https://github.com/skipmcgee).

### Directory listing for Code 102:
  - [Initial Learning](/initial_learning.md)
  - [Computer Setup](/computer_setup.md)
  - To Be Developed
  

***I would love to get your feedback to improve the quality and caliber of my code!***

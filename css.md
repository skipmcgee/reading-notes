#### Notes from Chapter 10

- CCS works by matching an HTML element to a rule to govern how the element should be displayed
- CCS rules consist of a selector and a declaration
- Declarations consist of a property and a value
- Use a single style sheet to maintain the formatting for multiple pages, use the HTML <link> element to specify the file
- some authors use one CSS file for formatting and another for layout
- can use a style tag with type="text/CSS" for inline CSS formatting, usually better to use a separate file
- The link element (includes href, type & rel) inside the head identifies the pointer to the CSS file
- One link element is required for each CSS file
- Online tools to test webpage in different browsers: BrowserCam.com, BrowserLab.Adobe.com, BrowserShots.org, CrossBrowserTesting.com
- For CSS bugs check these resources: PositionIsEverything.net, QuirksMode.org

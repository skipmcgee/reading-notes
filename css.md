#### Notes from Chapter 10

- Use a single style sheet to maintain the formatting for multiple pages, use the HTML <link> element to specify the file
- some authors use one CSS file for formatting and another for layout
- can use a style tag with type="text/CSS" for inline CSS formatting, usually better to use a separate file
